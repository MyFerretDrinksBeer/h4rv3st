Simple and effective email harvester written in JavaScript/node.js.  With 3 commands you can get a list of thousands of URL's, from only a single URL (script will spider to all URL's and save them), and then begin checking each URL for any email addresses. Once the harvest is complete it will save all results in a .txt file.
